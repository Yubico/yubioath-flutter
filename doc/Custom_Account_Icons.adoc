== Custom Account Icons
Yubico Authenticator supports adding a custom icon pack to use for your OATH
(TOTP/HOTP) accounts, making the list a bit easier to navigate. Icon packs must
be in the
https://github.com/beemdevelopment/Aegis/blob/master/docs/iconpacks.md[Aegis Icon Pack format].
You can use one of the existing pre-built packages from
https://aegis-icons.github.io/ or
https://github.com/alexbakker/aegis-simple-icons, or you can create your own.

=== Installing an icon pack
Once you have an icon pack on your computer or Android device and wish to use
it, follow these steps:

1. Open the Yubico Authenticator app and insert or tap your OATH-enabled YubiKey.
2. Make sure the `Accounts` section is chosen, where you can see your list of accounts.
3. Press the `Configure YubiKey` button, and select `Custom icons` from the menu.
4. Press the `Load icon pack` button, select the icon pack zip-file, and wait for it to load.

Once done, any account that has an issuer that is supported by the icon pack
will display the custom icon instead of the standard colored circle with a
letter. You can also use the `Custom icons` dialog to replace the icon pack, or
to remove it.
