=== Features
* Add a credential by scanning a QR code on the screen
* Favorite your most used credentials for easy access
* Keep your secret seeds safe by storing them on a YubiKey
* Require a touch on YubiKey to generate the code
* Protect your credentials with a device password
* Connect an external smart card reader and use the YubiKey over NFC

=== Supported devices
Usage of this software requires a compatible YubiKey device. Yubico
Authenticator is capable of provisioning and using both slot-based credentials
(compatible with any YubiKey that supports OTP) as well as the more powerful
standalone OATH functionality found on the NEO, YubiKey 4 and YubiKey 5 series.
To use the standalone OATH functionality your YubiKey must have the CCID mode enabled,
which can be done by using the https://developers.yubico.com/yubikey-manager-qt/[YubiKey Manager].
