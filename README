== Yubico Authenticator
Cross-platform application for generating Open Authentication (OATH) time-based TOTP and event-based HOTP one-time password codes, with the help of a YubiKey that protects the shared secrets.

=== Features
* Add a credential by scanning a QR code on the screen
* Favorite your most frequently used credentials for easy access
* Keep your secret seeds safe by storing them on a YubiKey
* Require a touch on the YubiKey to generate the code
* Protect your credentials with a device password
* Connect an external smart card reader and use the YubiKey over NFC

=== Supported devices
Usage of this software requires a compatible YubiKey. Yubico Authenticator is capable of provisioning and using both slot-based credentials
(compatible with any YubiKey that supports OTP) and the more powerful standalone OATH functionality found on the NEO, YubiKey 4 and YubiKey 5 series.
To use the standalone OATH functionality your YubiKey must have the CCID mode enabled, which can be done by using the https://developers.yubico.com/yubikey-manager-qt/[YubiKey Manager].

=== Installation
Downloads for all supported operating systems are available on the https://developers.yubico.com/yubioath-desktop/Releases/[Yubico Authenticator release page].

The following operating systems are supported. The application may still run on other platforms.

* Windows 8.1 or later
* macOS High Sierra 10.13 or later
