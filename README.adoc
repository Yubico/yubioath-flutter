image:splash.png[]

Store your unique credential on a hardware-backed security key and take it
wherever you go from mobile to desktop. No more storing sensitive secrets on
your mobile phone, leaving your account vulnerable to takeovers. With the
Yubico Authenticator you can raise the bar for security.

* The Yubico Authenticator will work with any USB or NFC-enabled YubiKeys

The Yubico Authenticator securely generates a code used to verify your identity
as you are logging into various services. No connectivity needed!

=== Features include
* Secure - Hardware-backed strong two-factor authentication with secret stored
  on the YubiKey, not on your phone or computer
* Portable - Get the same set of codes across our other Yubico Authenticator
  apps for desktops as well as for all leading mobile platforms
* Flexible - Support for time-based and counter-based code generation
* USB or NFC usage - Insert the YubiKey into the USB port, or use the YubiKey
  with NFC with a mobile phone that is NFC-enabled or a desktop NFC reader to
  store your credential on the YubiKey
* Easy Setup - QR codes available from the services you wish to protect with
  strong authentication
* User Presence - Require a touch on the YubiKey sensor to generate new codes
  for sensitive accounts
* Compatible - Secure all the services currently compatible with other
  Authenticator apps
* Versatile - Support for multiple work and personal accounts
