=== Installation
Downloads for all supported operating systems are available
https://www.yubico.com/products/yubico-authenticator/[here].

==== Linux
On Linux platforms you will need pcscd installed and running to be able to
communicate with a YubiKey over the SmartCard interface. Additionally, you may
need to set permissions for your user to access YubiKeys via the HID
interfaces. The relevant permissions are described
https://developers.yubico.com/yubikey-manager/Device_Permissions.html[here].

For some configurations running Wayland, copying an OTP to clipboard only works
when the app has focus. If you are unable to reliably copy to clipboard from
the systray icon, you can use a separate binary which take the payload to stdin
by defining the environment variable `_YA_TRAY_CLIPBOARD`. Note that this must
be an absolute path to a binary owned by root:root, and should not be
world-writable.
For example: `_YA_TRAY_CLIPBOARD=/usr/bin/wl-copy`.

NOTE: Only use a trusted binary, OTPs will be sent to this when copied to clipboard from the systray!
